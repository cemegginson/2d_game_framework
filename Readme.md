###2D Game Framework###

This originally started out as my final project in Advanced Game Programming,
but it ended up going through some transformations that led to the formation of
two projects. My original intention with this was to develop it into a full
blown engine for 2D games, and I may either still do that or do it the hard way
by using a full blown OpenGL or Vulkan renderer. Quite frankly I'm unsure, so
I'm leaving this here for now.

In any case, if you're just here to read my code you'd be much better off
reading my source in the 3d_app_framework project since that's where I go to cut
my teeth these days.
